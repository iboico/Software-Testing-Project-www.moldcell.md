# This is my personal project that consists in testing a web application and contains five parts: a mind map (Xmind), a PowerPoint Presentation, Test Data for Smoke Tests and Smoke Test Cases (Excel) and a Test Report (Word). Through the types of testing learned and the testing techniques applied I found 48 Test Cases (26 - Exploratory and 22 - Smoke) and after their execution, I found 21 bugs.
