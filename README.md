# About project
This is my personal project that consists in testing a web application and contains five parts: 
1. a mind map (Xmind) 
2. a PowerPoint Presentation
3. Test Data for Smoke Tests (Excel)
4. Smoke Test Cases (Excel)
5. Test Report (Word)
Through the types of testing learned and the testing techniques applied I found 48 Test Cases (26 - Exploratory and 22 - Smoke) and after their execution, I found 21 bugs.
