# About project
This is my personal project that consists in testing a web application and contains five parts: 
1. A mind map (Xmind) 
2. A PowerPoint Presentation
3. Test Data for Smoke Tests (Excel)
4. Smoke Test Cases (Excel)
5. Test Report (Word)

Through the types of testing learned and the testing techniques applied I found 48 Test Cases (26 - Exploratory and 22 - Smoke) and after their execution, I found 21 bugs.

# Project Management

1. Create a mind map (Xmind)
2. Exploratory Testing for main functionalities
3. Apply test design techniques such as equivalence class partition, boundary value analysis
4. Write the Smoke Tests and execute them
5. Write the Test Data Set
6. Bug Reporting under Mantis
7. Write the Test Report

# Tools used

1. Xmind - Mind maps
2. Mantis bug tracker - Bug Reporting
3. Microsoft Excel - Test Case Management, Test Data
4. Microsoft Word - Test Report
5. Lightshot Screenshot - Screenshots Capture

# Conclusions

Smoke Test Cases (happy flows), for the main functionalities in a percent of 100% were executed, 78% passed and 22% failed. The failed test cases are related to the Cart content, Wishlist and Search functionality.

A total number of 21 new bugs were identified, most of them were identified as normal severity (11 bugs), 4 of them as blocker severity and the rest of 6 bugs were major severity. No bugs were validated.

In addition to Smoke and Positive testing, testing types such as: Functional Testing, Exploratory, Compatibility, Negative, UI, Usability, were covered.

Exploratory testing was performed for important functionalities. A large number of bugs were identified during exploratory testing, 7 of them are normal, 6 of them are major and 2 of them are blocker. Most of them are related to the Registration, Account settings, but also for other functionalities.

Most of the bugs were identified by Negative Testing.

Compatibility testing was also performed, for different browsers. The bugs reproduce on all browsers. The main functionalities are working the same with other environment.
